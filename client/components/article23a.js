      <h1>Article 23-A</h1>
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <h4>
        Article 23-A is the piece of the Fair Chance Act that prohibits an
        employer from unfairly discriminating against a person purely on the
        basis of criminal conviction. This law has 8 specific factors that
        employers must consider when evaluating a person with a prior
        conviction. This allows for case-by-case consideration, and ensures that
        no single factor should determine the entire hiring process.
      </h4>

      <h2>The 8 Factors Are:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          New York State encourages the employment of persons with prior
          convictions.
          <h5>
            Do you live in New York? Your state wants employers to provide
            opportunities to residents who have criminal convictions
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the
          license or employment sought.
          <h5>
            What does the job actually entail? What are the day to day
            responsibilities of the job? Does it require any special skills?
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The bearing, if any, the criminal offense(s) for which the person was
          convicted will have on their ability to perform the job duties.
          <h5>
            Does the job relate to the charge? Could the conviction make you
            less suitable for that particlar job? For example, someone with a
            gun charge would not be eligible for a security position (without a
            Certificate of Relief). Or, someone convicted of a burglary might
            not be suitable for a job as a bank teller. Don't worry though-
            there are other jobs that will be a good fit for you!
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The time that has elapsed since the occurance of the criminal
          offense(s).
          <h5>
            How long has it been since the crime was committed? Remember- this
            is different from when you might have received a conviction. Showing
            that time has passed since the committed crime creates space between
            the decision you made then and the person you are now.
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The age of the person at the time of the occurance of the criminal
          offense(s).
          <h5>
            How old were you when the crime was committed? It is scientific fact
            that our brains are not fully developed as adolescents, so being
            able to address how your decision making skills and mentality has
            developed and matured since then is key.
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The seriousness of the offense(s).
          <h5>
            It is important that different charges are examined differently. If
            you have a nonviolent conviction, or if there is context to the
            charge that you think is appropriate for a hiring mangager to know,
            then let them know. The criminalization of poverty is very real- and
            the responsibility of that is on the structure of our society.
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          Any information produced by the person, or produced on behalf of the
          person, in regard to their rehabilitation and good conduct.
          <h5>
            What have you done since then? This is an opportunity for you to
            take control of your own story. What did you learn through your
            experience? Did you go back to school or start/finish a GED program?
            Did you receive any certifications (Food Handlers License, OSHA
            tranings, apprenticeships) since the time of the offense? This is
            your opportunity to show the upward direction you are striving for,
            and that you are not interested in making decisions that will push
            you backwards.
          </h5>
        </li>

        <li>
          The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in
          protecting property, and the safety and welfare of the general public.
          <h5>
            Will hiring you put anyone at risk? This includes other employees
            and customers. This is a big one! You want to demonstrate that you
            will be a benefit to the company, and not a risk.
          </h5>
