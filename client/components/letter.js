      <p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>

      <p>
        My name is {firstName} {lastName} and I am writing this letter in
        regards to my candidacy for the {position} position at {company}. I am
        grateful for the opportunity to be considered for this role as I believe
        I can be a great asset to {company}. I understand that there may be some
        concerns from the results of my background check and Iâ€™d like to address
        each of them to show why I am still fit and very capable of handling the
        responsibilities of the position.
      </p>

      <p>
        <div>
          I believe I am a great fit for the {position} position. {jobDuties}
        </div>
      </p>

      <p>
        <div>
          I understand that there might be concerns about my fitness in this
          position given my history. However, the {position} position and its
          responsibilities do not intersect with the charge and will have no
          bearing on my ability to operate successfully. {related}
        </div>

      <p>
        <div>
          Furthermore, I was in a very different state when the offense occured.{' '}

          I know that a big objective of Article 23-A of The Fair Chance Act is
          to allow an opportunity to provide context around a conviction and
          allow the situation to be understood in its entirety. {serious}
        </div>
      </p>

      <p>
        <div>
          I have been working to move my life in a direction that I believe is
          more representative of who I am. {rehab} All of these factors
          demonstrate the growth I've experienced since the offense.
        </div>

        <div>
          I hope this letter has provided more clarity and insight into who I am
          and how I've grown as a person. {safetyIssues} I am confident that I
          will be a great {position} and that I can contribute to the overall
          success at {company}. Please don't hesitate to reach me at {email} if
          you have any further questions. Thank you again for taking the time to
          read this letter and allowing me the opportunity to show why I'd be a
          great addition to your team.
